# Titanic Data Analysis: Who Survived?

Hey everyone! This is a project where I take a deep dive into the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to use data analysis to find out what factors played a role in who survived the tragic sinking. It's a classic dataset, and it's a great way to practice some core data science skills.

### What's Inside

The `titanic_analysis.ipynb` notebook is the heart of this project. Here's what you'll find:

* **Data Cleaning:** The raw data has some missing values and needs a bit of tidying up. I've included steps to handle that so the data is ready for analysis.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I use visualizations like bar charts and pie charts to explore the data. This helps us see things like the distribution of passengers by class, age, and gender.

* **Survival Factors:** The main part of the analysis focuses on uncovering the relationships between different passenger attributes and their survival rate. We'll look at key factors like gender, age, passenger class, and more.

### How to Run This Yourself

Want to explore the data on your own? It's pretty straightforward!

1.  First, clone this repository to your local machine.

2.  Make sure you have a Python environment set up with Jupyter Notebook and the necessary libraries installed. If not, you can get them with this command:

    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    
    ```

3.  The dataset is available on Kaggle. You'll need to download the `train.csv` file from the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

4.  Place the `train.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook.

5.  Finally, open the notebook in your Jupyter environment and run through the cells. You can follow my steps or try your own analysis!
